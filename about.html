  <div>
    <p style="color: white;">


      HB Nursery germinated in 2014 from a promise to make ‘green and healthy’ a click away for all Indians

      Having plants in our homes or in our offices doesn’t just look good, it also boosts our mood, makes us more
      productive, and cleans the air around us by absorbing toxins

      Most of us being urban dwellers spending their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological
      reserves, have no way of feeling close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants.

      Ordering a pizza is easy but ever heard of ordering a plant to your doorstep? This is where HB Nursery comes in.
